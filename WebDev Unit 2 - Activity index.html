            This week has been quite demanding due to work obligations. However, I finally had my first day off this month, which allowed me to exercise, focus on my academic assignments, and recharge.  I am truly grateful for the opportunity to catch up on both my personal health and schoolwork.</p>

            What I've Learned in WEB101 So Far
        </h3>
        <p id="aboutWeek">
            So far, I have learned that web development is about far more than just the ability to 
            write code. There's a comprehensive process involved, starting with conceptualizing a 
            wireframe, then integrating robust front-end and back-end functionalities, ensuring 
            security measures are in place, and finally deploying a full-stack website that meets 
            both user and business needs. Effective project management skills, thorough testing, 
            and continuous iterations are crucial at each step to create a secure and successful 
            final product.

            <li>Ensuring robust security and data protection is crucial, it is important to stay current with security patches and address common vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Users expect fast, responsive web applications. Optimize page load times, minimize server response latency, and consider caching strategies to handle high volumes of traffic.</li>
            <li>Design any interface with its users in mind by making navigation intuitive and prioritizing mobile responsiveness.</li>
